				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="55" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/screen-shot-2013-04-04-at-16-13-00.png?w=100&amp;h=55&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="GetNinjas" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/getninjas">GetNinjas</a>, a local services marketplace startup based in São Paulo, Brazil has closed a $3 million Series A round backed by new investor Otto Ventures, with existing investors <a target="_blank" href="http://monashees.com.br/">Monashees</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/kaszek-ventures">KaszeK Ventures</a> also participating. The latter both invested in GetNinjas&#8217; 2011 seed round, which raised a total of $700,000.</p>
<p>GetNinjas&#8217; offers an online platform for a diverse range of professionals and tradespeople &#8212; from mechanics and manicurists to nannies, illustrators and school tutors &#8212; to advertise their services, and also for consumers to find the particular professional they&#8217;re looking for. This sort of local services business necessarily tends to be a regional operation &#8212; with a plethora of startups going after similar services offerings in their own backyards, such as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.redbeacon.com/">Red Beacon</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mytime.com/">MyTime</a> in the U.S. or <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/25/another-online-labour-booking-funding-win-intel-capital-leads-4m-series-a-in-russias-eruditor/">Eruditor</a> in Russia.</p>
<p>The rule of thumb seems to be that if a services transaction requires a service provider to actually meet with the customer &#8212; rather than being able to deliver a digital product remotely, as is the case with most of the services offered on <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/17/peopleperhour-secures-3-2m-from-index-ventures-new-hires-new-ios-app/">PeoplePerHour</a>, for instance &#8211; then the business tends to be more geographically bounded. Language barriers, location-specific client and service provider networks and the need to understand marketplace idiosyncrasies all play a part in keeping the startup&#8217;s focus regional.</p>
<p>GetNinjas&#8217; focus is firmly on Latin America, says founder and CEO Eduardo L&#8217;Hotellier, competing in the Latam services marketplace with the likes of <a target="_blank" href="http://recomind.net/">recomind</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://bougue.com.br/">bougue</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://workana.com/">Workana</a>. Its aim is to become &#8220;<em>the</em> <strong></strong>Latin American player for local services,&#8221; he says &#8212; which he argues is plenty of territory to scale local services into a very big business. &#8221;[Ecommerce/auction site] <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mercadolibre.com/">Mercado Libre</a> built an amazing $4 billion (market cap) company focusing in Latam; I think a services player has the same potential in the region,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>GetNinjas plans to use its new funding to ramp up its headcount, especially by adding more developers to work on making its platform more responsive &#8212; so that &#8220;clients and pros have a great response in great time&#8221;. It&#8217;s even looking as far afield as the U.S. to hire developer talent, says L&#8217;Hotellier, thanks to fierce competition in the local market for software smarts.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a lot of things planned out to smooth the user experience from both sides (for clients and pros), and having a strong engineering team is vital to get that done with the quality and timing we want. It&#8217;s also a huge challenge, as the &#8216;war for (developer) talent&#8217; in Brazil is pretty hot right now, so much that we are currently interviewing people from all over the Americas for a São Paulo job,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch. &#8220;We&#8217;re working on projects and our internal processes to improve response times and rates for the business we mediate in all of Brazil&#8217;s key markets.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other plans for the funding include &#8220;redoubling our marketing efforts, evaluating new channels to reach the broad base we need, and investing in the infrastructure and costs (telecoms, third party apps) we need to get those ideas to improve the user experience rolling&#8221;.</p>
<p>Rather than focusing in on a particular services niche &#8212; be it health or education services &#8212; GetNinjas&#8217; strategy is to throw the services net wide, which it hopes will help it scale up the business, fuelled by repeat business as customers can use it for multiple services needs. &#8220;That, of course, also means we have a very diverse set of challenges to overcome, but we believe the advantages more than make up for them, and we can also leverage ideas and learnings across different categories,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>The startup, which was founded in April 2011, is currently processing &#8220;around 30,000 service requests per month&#8221; &#8212; which are &#8220;roughly distributed throughout Brazil&#8221;. São Paulo is the single biggest location, with just under 15% of the requests, but L&#8217;Hotellier said that percentage mirrors the city&#8217;s size in Brazil. &#8220;That broad base of clients is one of the pillars of our strategy, and one we&#8217;re pretty happy with currently,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, L&#8217;Hotellier says the plan is to expand to other &#8220;key markets&#8221; in Latin America, as well as continuing to improve the services offering within Brazil.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s still a lot of work to be done before we get the &#8216;online local services marketplace&#8217; to the level of sophistication and ease of use we want. And I believe that&#8217;s true not only of GetNinjas, but of all players trying their hand at this relatively new business,&#8221; he says, when asked whether it might look to launch additional products on top of the services platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s still a huge, wide open opportunity, so starting shooting at other targets right now would be a waste of energy we can put towards our number one goal &#8211; to be THE solution to find local services online in Brazil and in Latin America.&#8221;</p>

After the handset was spotted both in both the FCC&#8217;s and Verizon&#8217;s systems, noted leaker <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/320360832833835009">@evleaks</a> has come through yet again with a new image of the upcoming Nokia Lumia 928 (formerly known as the &#8220;Catwalk&#8221;).</p>
<p>There&#8217;s not a whole lot to be gleaned from the image save for the fact that the device seems to have done away with the rounded sides and flat top and bottom edges of its immediate predecessor the Lumia 920. As it turns out, one of the neatest features of the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/03/nokia-said-to-be-prepping-an-aluminum-clad-lumia-for-release-later-this-year/">initial Catwalk leak</a> is nowhere to be found here &#8212; according to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/5/4189290/nokia-lumia-928-verizon-images-leak">The Verge</a>, the Lumia 928 will sport a more traditional polycarbonate body instead of the aluminum chassis that was originally slated for the device way back wehn. Most of the 928&#8242;s internals (think the 1.5GHz dual-core Qualcomm MSM8960 processor, 1GB of RAM, and 32GB of internal storage) are expected to remain the same as its cousin the 920, but Nokia may run with an OLED panel this time around rather than the IPS LCD as seen in the 920.</p>
<p>In short, it&#8217;s hard not to think of the Lumia 928 as what the Lumia 920 should&#8217;ve been when it launched.</p>
<p>According to recent figures from <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/01/android-and-windows-phone-gain-blackberry-loses-in-smartphone-os-share-according-to-kantar/">Kantar Worldpanel</a>, Windows Phone has managed to pull away from BlackBerry in terms of mobile OS market share, and devices like the 928 should help Microsoft&#8217;s mobile efforts pick up a little more steam in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, Nokia has been working to make its Windows Phones the most feature-rich out there with exclusivity agreements with companies like <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/28/digital-magazine-app-zinio-will-make-its-windows-phone-debut-as-a-nokia-lumia-exclusive/">Zinio</a>, so it&#8217;s clear that some developers are starting to see the benefits of embracing the prospect of developing for the Windows Phone platform.</p>
<p>That said, WP&#8217;s third place position isn&#8217;t completely safe at this point &#8212; BlackBerry posted some <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/28/blackberry-posts-promising-q4-results-after-bb10-launch-eps-of-0-22-revenue-of-2-7b-1m-z10s-shipped/">promising quarterly financials</a> and if recent leaks are to be believed, a low-cost BlackBerry 10 device with a QWERTY keyboard could see the light very soon. Z10 shipments point to reasonably healthy demand, and an affordable device launched in key markets could be just what the doctor ordered for BlackBerry.</p>

<p>While the average tech-savvy Austinite has probably forgotten that campaign, it looks like Google didn&#8217;t &#8212; local ABC affiliate <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kvue.com/news/Google-Fiber-coming-to-Austin-201695291.html">KVUE </a>reported earlier this evening that Google will indeed announce its Austin Fiber rollout early next week citing multiple sources from within the city&#8217;s government.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s back up a minute first. Earlier today, Google and representatives of the City of Austin sent out invitations to a secretive announcement about something that would have a &#8220;positive impact on Austinites and the future of the city.&#8221; Incredibly vague, right? The fuzzy wording of the invitation left the door open for many interpretations, but a potential Fiber rollout seemed like the most likely suspect. After taking a gander at the invitation and conferring with their own sources,<a target="_blank" href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/04/05/google-fiber-coming-to-austin-city-government-google-holding-a-meeting-next-week-to-announce-something/"> VentureBeat</a> reported that there was a strong possibility that Google and representatives of the Austin government would announce just such an endeavor next Tuesday morning, and now KVUE&#8217;s reports seem to have sealed the deal.</p>
<p>While the news seems to have slipped out ahead of schedule, there&#8217;s still no word on any of the specifics of the plan and Google is assuredly aiming to keep quiet on the matter for the next few days. Still, Google will have plenty of tech-savvy neighbors to keep it company as it begins its work in Texas&#8217; capital city &#8212; Apple operates a sizable campus there that&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/12/apple-austin/">only going to grow</a> in the coming months, Dell has been camped out there for years, and Samsung churns out plenty of chips out in its Austin fabrication plants. That&#8217;s just the tip of the tech iceberg out in those parts, and the move to bring Fiber to Austin should see Google take on a slightly more prominent position in the city before long.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s existing office is ensconced in a high-rise across the freeway from UT Austin&#8217;s J.J. Pickle Research Campus, but that won&#8217;t do for when it comes time to deal with its customers. Expect Google to secure some more consumer-friendly space to act as a showroom/customer service center for its first wave of Fiber subscribers, just as it did with its so-called Fiber Space in Kansas City&#8217;s Volker neighborhood.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve reached out to Google for comment on the matter, and will update this story if/when I hear back.</p>

Follow him on Twitter <a target="_blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/jeremysliew">@jeremysliew</a>.</em></p>
<p>As a VC, my interest in the <a target="_blank" href="http://lsvp.com/2013/03/28/how-bitcoin-works/">Bitcoin</a> ecosystem is not ideological but mercenary. I see the opportunity for Bitcoin to disrupt multi-billion-dollar markets, but in doing so also create new big markets. There are three key markets in Bitcoin:</p>
<p><strong>Wallet. </strong>Holding your Bitcoins for you, serving some of the checking account functions of a bank.</p>
<p><strong>Exchange.</strong> Converting from USD to Bitcoins and back.</p>
<p><strong>Payments.</strong> Helping merchants accept Bitcoins for their transactions.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, VCs like to see billion-dollar markets to get excited. How can each of these markets get to be a billion dollars in size?</p>
<h5><b>Wallet</b></h5>
<p>It is free to get your own Bitcoin wallet, a piece of software on your computer that you can use to send or receive Bitcoins. However, this entails storing your Bitcoin private key on your computer, which risks loss or theft. Increasingly many Bitcoin users are turning to hosted wallets, which hold the money for you, and are accessed over the web. But you have to trust that your hosted wallet will not run off with your money (which has happened before). Because client wallets are free, hosted wallets have typically been free, as well.</p>
<p>Let’s assume that one day in the future, hosted wallets will be able to charge 0.5 percent of funds in the account as an annual fee. This is likely a high estimate, but not impossible if the wallet offers enhanced security, insurance against loss, and perhaps some kind of escrow or other fraud purchase protection. For the wallet market to be worth $1 billion, this would imply that $1 billion/0.5% = $200 billion in Bitcoins would need to be held in hosted wallets. This means that the market cap of Bitcoin would need to be at least $200 billion, relative to $1.5 billion today. Bitcoin would need to appreciate by almost 150x to reach this level. <a target="_blank" href="http://blockchain.info/charts/market-cap">Bitcoin has gone up by 30x in the last year</a>, so that isn’t impossible to believe. Two more years like that would get you there.</p>
<h5><b>Exchange</b></h5>
<p>It will be a long time, and probably never, that Bitcoin becomes the default world currency. As a result, there will be demand for exchanging between Bitcoin and fiat currency for a very long time.</p>
<p>Consumer level exchanges charge between 50 to 100 basis points on each trade. Bigger trades currently pay closer to 10 basis points. Let’s assume that in the future trading commissions run around 25 basis points. To get to $1 billion in market size we would need to see $1 billion/0.25% = $400 billion in annual trading volume. Last month, <a target="_blank" href="http://blockchain.info/charts/trade-volume">exchange volume was around $60 million, this month it looks like it may get to $200 million</a>. Annualizing this gets you to between $720 million &#8211; $2.4 billion in annual trading volume. Assuming the top end of the estimates, trading volume would need to go up by 200x current levels to hit this market size.</p>
<p>Transaction volume, i.e. transfers of Bitcoin within the real economy, has <a target="_blank" href="http://blockchain.info/charts/tx-trade-ratio">historically floated within a constant multiple of trading volume of between 2 and 20</a>. If the relationship between transaction volume and trading volume remains roughly linear, transaction volume would need to rise by 200x current levels to hit our target $1 billion market size. This is believable given that transaction volume has gone up 30x in the last year.</p>
<h5><b>Payments</b></h5>
<p>Ultimately, the key driver of both Bitcoin price appreciation and exchange volume has to be payments volume. If people aren’t using Bitcoin to pay merchants for transactions, then there is no real economic driver for either price or exchange volume to rise. It would be driven purely by speculation.</p>
<p>One of the key advantages of Bitcoin is that it nominally has zero transaction costs. That being said, there are a number of additional merchant services that could be added on top of transaction processing that could justify 25 basis points or more in merchant fees. Bitpay today charges 1% or more. To get to $1 billion in market size, we would need to see $1 billion/0.25% = $400 billion in annual transaction volume.</p>
<p>Last month, transaction volume was around $250 million, and this month it looks like it is on track for $750 million. Annualizing this gets you to between $3 billion and $9 billion in annual transaction volume. Again, taking the top end of estimates, this would require an increase in transaction volume of around 50x current levels. In the last year, transaction volumes have gone up by 30x. As a comparison point, world GDP is around $82 trillion, so this would represent about 0.5 percent of all world transactions using Bitcoin. As a comparison point, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/credit-card-industry-facts-personal-debt-statistics-1276.php#Total-purchases-transactions">$2.5 trillion is spent on credit cards per year</a> in the U.S. alone out of $15 trillion in GDP, so about 16 percent.</p>
<h5>How Do We Get There?</h5>
<p>All of these market-sizing analyses require a 2 to 2.5 order of magnitude increase over current levels. Those same metrics have shown a 1 to 1.5x order of magnitude increase in the last year, so it doesn’t stretch the imagination to think that it might be possible. But the question is how? It would be impossible to get to those sizes on illicit usage only and you can’t get there just on speculation. Bitcoin usage would have to become mainstream. The only way to get there is through merchant preference because of the lower transaction costs. This could be appealing to industries with low net margins (e.g. grocery, Amazon.com), or with high transaction costs (e.g. cross border trade, micro transactions), and these may be the industries that pioneer Bitcoin acceptance.</p>
<p>But merchants won’t switch to Bitcoin for lower transaction costs if the tradeoff is volatility of exchange rates. As long as their costs are in fiat currency, they will want to switch out of Bitcoin and into fiat immediately when they take payment since they won’t want to bear currency risk. That requires deep liquidity in the exchanges, and this is where the professional traders come in. They have already started to enter the market.</p>
<p>If the current volatility in the Bitcoin exchange rate is reduced in the future, merchants may be willing to hold Bitcoins for longer periods of time, and even make payments in Bitcoins.</p>
<p>The other way that Bitcoin may become mainstream is in countries where the currency or financial system is already more volatile than Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Mainstream adoption will require bright line regulatory compliance by all elements of the Bitcoin ecosystem. That is why last month’s <a target="_blank" href="http://fincen.gov/statutes_regs/guidance/html/FIN-2013-G001.html">guidance on virtual currencies from FinCEN</a> (part of the U.S. Treasury) caused Bitcoin prices to go up. As Bitcoin gets closer to the U.S. regulatory umbrella, it moves closer to legitimacy. These rules and the ones that will follow will increase the overhead costs of all players in the space, but that is a small price to pay for legitimacy.</p>
<h5>What Does It Mean For Startups?</h5>
<p>Not all big markets are opportunities for startups. Bitcoin has some attractive characteristics because it is so disruptive to the current system. The innovator’s dilemma may keep the big players in payments out of the market for a long time, as they may fear cannibalizing their current very attractive margins. But one day that competition will come.</p>
<p>The key questions for any startup are: What is your competitive advantage and how do you defend against a large late entrant? For exchanges, liquidity is the barrier to entry. Although there have been examples where new entrants have cracked open marketplace businesses, it is hard. For wallet and merchant services, it is less clear what the barriers to entry will be.</p>
<p>The risks associated with Bitcoin are worth mentioning as well. The <a target="_blank" href="http://siliconangle.com/blog/2011/08/01/third-largest-bitcoin-exchange-bitomat-lost-their-wallet-over-17000-bitcoins-missing/">six</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/06/bitcoin-price-plummets-on-compromised-exchange/">biggest</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://betabeat.com/2011/08/search-for-owners-of-mybitcoin-loses-steam/">hacking</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/08/bitcoinica-users-sue-for-460k-in-lost-bitcoins/">theft</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://pandodaily.com/2012/08/31/bitcoin-how-a-virtual-currency-became-real-with-a-5-6m-fraud/">fraud</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-19486695">incidents</a> involving Bitcoin exchanges, wallets, or investment vehicles have resulted in a total 1.2 million Bitcoins being stolen, out of a total of 11 million Bitcoins in existence. This means that more than 10 percent of all Bitcoin has been stolen, and this does not include many smaller thefts and losses from individual wallets. Just this week, another wallet service <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/03/bitcoin-instawallet/">was shut down after suffering an attack</a>. Given this environment, Bitcoin startups cannot remain bootstrapped for long and will need to raise more substantial capital from VCs to mitigate these risks with better security and proactive regulatory functions.</p>
<p>In all the scenarios that I’ve painted above, Bitcoin prices need to go up by 100x or more. If that were the case, then maybe just buying Bitcoin is a better investment than putting money into a Bitcoin startup. You get plenty of upside and no execution risk, but it won’t be anywhere near as much fun.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We normally don&#8217;t cover criminal accusations against individuals without police reports or other documents filed, or significant evidence like <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/25/rabois-left-square-over-sexual-harassment-claim/">self-acknowledgement.</a> But we&#8217;re making an exception.</p>
<p>TechCrunch founder <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/michael-arrington">Michael Arrington</a> is facing <a target="_blank" href="http://www.techmeme.com/130405/p28#a130405p28">very public</a> accusations involving physical threats, assault and rape. Given his relationship with us this past year, and the culture of transparency that he helped create, we&#8217;re sharing where we are at with our reporting on the story.</p>
<p>We take all of these allegations seriously. We are treating them like any other story of this magnitude, in that we have been working to understand the situation as thoroughly as we can before publishing about it. We have a little more to add at this point, while we are continuing to report the story.</p>
<p>The original claim, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/jennallen.RTist/posts/10151504369260138">posted on Facebook</a> by former girlfriend Jenn Allen, is that he physically abused her, then threatened to kill her if she told anyone about the episode. <a target="_blank" href="http://gawker.com/5993171">Gawker found her post</a>, and she followed up with additional comments there claiming that he had raped her as well as another woman.</p>
<p>Rumors of similar alleged abuse have circulated in previous years amongst our peers. Many tech reporters have investigated them, but no stories had been published until those based on Allen&#8217;s posts this week.</p>
<p>Some former friends of Arrington&#8217;s, including <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/jcalacanis/posts/10151817217978294">Jason Calacanis</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Bf7Q77LFWKM">Loren Feldman</a> have come forward this week to support her general claim, saying they have heard similar rumors. Another Arrington friend from that era, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/nik-cubrilovic">Nik Cubrilovic</a>, is <a target="_blank" href="https://gist.github.com/nikcub/5323021">now saying</a> that he lived in the same house as Arrington when Allen was also staying there and knew of no abuse.</p>
<p>Today, <a target="_blank" href="http://gawker.com/5993695/techcrunch-founder-michael-arringtons-history-of-abuse-allegations-includes-an-assault-investigation">Gawker unveiled another story</a> detailing an alleged assault by Arrington that took place at a company he worked at in 1999, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealNames">RealNames</a>. A colleague of Arrington&#8217;s, Cecile Sharp, is quoted in the article saying that he had assaulted another coworker. The article also quotes sources alleging that in 2009 he threw then-girlfriend, Meghan Asha, against a wall.</p>
<p>Neither Allen nor Arrington have provided us with comments at this time.</p>
<p>Regarding Allen&#8217;s claims, we are not yet able to determine if they are true or not. She has not filed any police complaint or lawsuit to our knowledge.</p>
<p>Regarding the RealNames allegation, we have confirmed that there was an accusation, the conclusion of which did not result in a punishment for Arrington. We are still trying to understand the details of that from other people who were at the company at the time. So far we have this from RealNames founder and long-time Arrington friend <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/keith-teare">Keith Teare</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mike was indeed the subject of an accusation at RealNames. As is normal in these circumstances an outside party was hired to conduct an investigation. This was extensive and I was never directly involved in it as I was not a witness to any events. The investigation concluded that there was no behavior to answer for. Mike was never reprimanded in any way. Both parties asked for confidentiality and to date this has been honored.&#8221;</p>
<p>Regarding the claim that Meghan Asha was thrown against a wall by Arrington in 2009, we have spoken to a number of secondary sources, some of whom claim that it happened and some who say it did not. Asha has not spoken publicly on the matter.</p>
<p>We have also spoken to two other women who Arrington had previously dated. One is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/rebecca-woodcock">Rebecca Woodcock,</a> who some rumors had indicated had suffered abuse from him while dating. She tells us this is absolutely not true. The other woman, who wishes to remain anonymous, also said that there was no abuse.</p>
<p>In sum, there have been some claims and more rumors about Arrington, as well as counterclaims and most of all, lots of missing information. We are continuing our reporting to find definitive evidence. We hope that anyone who knows more facts as to what happened between him and the women he is accused of abusing will come forward publicly, or <a target="_blank" href="mailto:editors@techcrunch.com">privately</a>.</p>

<p>Just a day after announcing a new <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/04/facebook-home-launch/">Android skin in the form of Facebook Home</a>, the company has issued a <a target="_blank" href="http://newsroom.fb.com/News/599/Answering-Your-Questions-on-Home-and-Privacy">FAQ regarding Facebook Home and privacy</a>. </p>
<p>Though many seem excited to see Facebook take baby steps toward a full-fledged operating system, some are also concerned that using Facebook as a portal to your smartphone could become risky given all the information Facebook already collects on us. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://gigaom.com/2013/04/04/why-facebook-home-bothers-me-it-destroys-any-notion-of-privacy/">Om Malik</a> expressed serious concerns over Facebook knowing your location at any given time, namely because they&#8217;d eventually be able to pin-point the location of your home, place of business, etc. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/what-the-new-facebook-phone-means-for-privacy/">Activist Parker Higgins</a> seemed concerned about the fact that Facebook would be reading text messages as well as Facebook messages. </p>
<p>Combining the two, along with when and how often we launch other apps, could give Facebook an even more powerful position in the app ecosystem and as an advertising platform. </p>
<p>If you find yourself expressing concerns over Facebook&#8217;s invasion of Android, here&#8217;s the important things you need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook Home is like an app. You can install it and delete it as you choose. </li>
<li>If you install it, Home collects information on all Facebook activity (like usual), plus location, Facebook messages, and that you&#8217;ve launched certain apps. This information is identifiable for 90 days before it is detached from your identity. </li>
<li>Incoming SMS are automatically pulled through the Facebook Home interface, but it sounds like Facebook isn&#8217;t pushing the content of those messages back to the mothership. </li>
<li>If Home comes pre-installed (for the HTC First and beyond), Facebook has access to all of the above, plus third-party notifications.</li>
<li>Facebook Home can <em>not</em> see your activity within other, non-Facebook apps, like Google Maps</li>
</ul>
<p>With regards to location, things get a bit tricky. As with any other app, you have complete control over location permission within Facebook Home settings, so you have every opportunity to turn off location data entirely. If you choose to leave location on, here&#8217;s what you&#8217;re working with.</p>
<p>From the new <a target="_blank" href="http://newsroom.fb.com/News/599/Answering-Your-Questions-on-Home-and-Privacy">statement on privacy</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Facebook Home doesn&#8217;t use location in any way that&#8217;s different from the Facebook app you already have on your Android phone. You can learn about how location works across Facebook in our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/your-info">Data Use Policy</a> and Help Center.</p></blockquote>
<p>That essentially means that, anytime you <em>use</em> Facebook (upload a picture, check in, post a status update, send a message) Facebook will be able to pin-point where that took place. However, a Facebook spokesperson <a target="_blank" href="http://edition.cnn.com/2013/04/05/tech/social-media/facebook-home-privacy/">explained to CNN</a> that Facebook will not actively be tracking the smartphone&#8217;s GPS location. </p>
<p>In other words, they aren&#8217;t pulling location data from us in any new ways, but they are putting Facebook in front of us <em>a lot</em> more, and will likely be able to gather <em>more</em> data in the exact same manner. </p>
<p>Whether this sounds shocking to you or not, it&#8217;s the trajectory we&#8217;re headed down. Zoom out for a moment: how many companies function on an ad-based revenue? Lots. This works because advertising is necessary, albeit annoying at some times. Without it, how would you know when <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/04/netflix-confirms-15-new-episodes-of-arrested-development-landing-may-26-at-1201-am-pt/">Arrested Development is returning</a> or that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/13/a-digital-guide-to-a-sexy-valentines-day/">Valentine&#8217;s Day is full of hot deals</a>. </p>
<p>If companies like Facebook can actually gather enough data to make ads meaningful and relevant, maybe we don&#8217;t have to hate those ads as much as we think we do. </p>
<p>Obviously, that&#8217;s a story for another day, considering Zuck merely foreshadowed advertising within Home, never giving an actual timeline. </p>
<p>Perhaps more interesting is the fact that Facebook feels it needs to educate users on this. The idea of Home is new &mdash; UI skins have been done on Android forever, but not by our single-most important online social tool. And it&#8217;s not like Facebook has never been used in the same sentence as &#8220;privacy issues,&#8221; whether you see that as innovative or terrifying. </p>
<p>Facebook has always pushed for more data, and been pushed back by its users. It&#8217;s a tale as old as Facebook itself. </p>
<p>But the social network has gone from being the web site we spend the most time on, to being the site we spend the most time on <em>plus</em> a little blue blip on our phones. Constant access. </p>
<p>Then, Facebook teamed up with Apple and built itself right into the OS. Oh, and some more little blue blips popped up, like Messenger and Poke. Now, Facebook will not only be the first web site you see on your laptop, perhaps the first app you open on your phone each morning. It will be the first thing you see every time you wake up your Android smartphone. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s a lot to take in. It&#8217;d be strange if you weren&#8217;t at least slightly concerned. Facebook knows this and thus, the explanation. </p>
<p>How much you want to bet we see a similar explanation when Facebook announces its Google Glass app? Glass Home? </p>
<p>Welcome to a new world. </p>

		<title>I Kind Of Love These “Exit Traffic Ads” That Show Up When You Leave A Site</title>

But I was recently browsing Wookiepedia, a Star Wars Wikia site, and when I clicked an external link it popped up a half-screen interstitial for 15 seconds before redirecting me to my destination. Instead of cluttering its site with more ads, Wookiepedia let me bounce around internally for free, but &#8220;charged&#8221; me to leave. And I was impressed. Advertising is the lifeblood of the consumer Internet. It finances content and utilities so they can be free and widely accessible. But too much advertising and the user experience degrades. No one wants to sift out value from a sea of marketing. Exit traffic ads seem like an elegant solution. They can take some ad strain off of a webpage and encourage more intra-site browsing. Depending on their implementation, they&#8217;re not that obstructive. On Wookiepedia, at least, you can click a &#8220;Skip this sd&#8221; button to go straight to your destination. Otherwise you can &#8216;x&#8217; an ad out or click &#8220;Want to go back?&#8221; to return to the page you were browsing. You can try it yourself by going to Wookiepedia and then clicking one of the &#8220;Official Friends&#8221; links at the bottom. Some people are going to hate these because they throw up barriers too open web browsing. I understand that. But I think they give businesses design freedom, so they can create a pure on-site experience by offloading the clutter. I want to see more of these exit traffic ads. I feel like they&#8217;re a smart alternative or complement to standard display media. They can be big and glossy, and the format ensures they&#8217;re noticed unlike most banners. It feels like a fair value exchange, too. A site points me towards something I want to check out, so I don&#8217;t feel so bad seeing one of their ads for a few seconds on the way out. I like them a hell of a lot more than the entry traffic interstitial ads that roadblock many content sites (*cough* other tech news blogs *cough*). It might even encourage sites to link externally more often. I can imagine exit traffic ads finding a place on social networks like Facebook and Twitter.

<p>What exactly is happening comes across as a bit vague &#8212; which is fitting, as Obvious&#8217; mission was purposefully vague at <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/28/biz-stone-steps-back-from-twitter-to-relaunch-obvious-with-ev-williams-and-jason-goldman/">the time that it was launched (or rather, re-launched) in 2011</a>, and over the years those involved have mostly preferred to let the corporation&#8217;s work and products speak for themselves. But the general gist is that as far as the focus of its founders, Obvious as an entity is taking a backseat to the individual startups it has produced and funded.</p>
<p>Medium, the Obvious-incubated <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/15/ev-williams-takes-to-medium-to-discuss-the-true-purpose-of-his-new-publishing-tool/">next-generation publishing platform</a>, is now operating as its own standalone company with Ev Williams spending &#8220;98 percent&#8221; of his time there. Some 30 staffers who previously were hired as Obvious employees are now working as full-time Medium employees.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as we&#8217;ve reported previously, Stone is working on a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/01/biz-stones-new-startup-jelly-sounds-like-a-home-for-do-gooders-on-the-go/">new company called Jelly</a>. Goldman, for his part, is spending the bulk of his time helping to lead Branch from New York City and currently looking for an additional company to work with.</p>
<p>The more general collaborative relationship between Goldman, Stone, and Williams will continue to be called &#8220;Obvious,&#8221; the blog post says, but the entity as a corporation seems to be winding down, or at least scaling back. He explained how they will continue to work together and detailed Obvious&#8217; affiliations like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8230;the collaboration between Biz, Jason, and myself — which we call &#8216;Obvious&#8217; — continues&#8230; Besides Medium, Branch, and Jelly, we have working relationships with Lift (of which I&#8217;m on the board), Beyond Meat and GoodFit (of which Biz is on the board) and Neighborland. We also have a handful of less-active partnerships with entrepreneurs we were lucky enough to angel invest in, like Findery, LaunchPad Toys, and Faraday Bikes. (There are a couple more, which we’ll announce when the time is right.)&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Via email today, Williams told TechCrunch that there are no hard feelings involved in the change &#8212; that it&#8217;s been a natural evolution over the past several months. In his blog post, he elaborated a bit on the reasons for the shift:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Turns out, we like focus. We rebooted Obvious in 2011 with a vague plan. We started investing, incubating, and experimenting to figure out what worked and what we wanted to do at this stage in our careers; we just knew we wanted to work together do stuff that mattered.</p>
<p>Among other things, the first few months taught us that we gravitated toward diving in more deeply on a small number of things — rather than having a lighter touch on many ventures.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;ll be exciting to see what the next chapter will bring for all involved here.</p>

Today, Heroku is putting the spotlight back on features again, with the launch of the public beta of its larger 2X dynos, which, in some ways, will also help alleviate the job-queuing issues that sparked the recent debate. The 2X dynos (dynos are basically the containers that run an application process on Heroku) will offer exactly what the name implies: twice the memory (1GB instead of 512MB) and also twice as many CPU shares as the basic dynos (now called 1X). During the beta phase, the 2X dynos will cost the same as $0.05 per hour as the 1X dynos. After that, they will cost, as their name implies, $0.10 per hour. Heroku is also exploring the option to launch even larger dynos (4X+) in the future. Heroku argues that these larger dynos will allow for increasing concurrency on single-threaded Rails apps using the Unicorn HTTP server for Rack applications. Heroku also says that the larger dynos will work well for JVM languages that can take advantage of the vertical scale the 2X dynos provide. In addition, the company says, this should help with performing memory-intensive background jobs for image processing and geospatial processing.]]></description>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/moot_logo.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="moot_logo" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p><a target="_blank" href="http://moot.it/">Moot</a>, a startup offering a new take on commenting and forums, is launching today after three and a half years of development with the goal of bringing these key pieces of Internet discussion into the modern era. Unlike many of the options for online discussion that exist today, Moot is designed to be very flexible and customizable, according to a site owner&#8217;s needs, while also being clean, simple, realtime, embeddable and cross-platform. It even works on mobile devices like iOS and Android smartphones and tablets.</p>
<p>The company was founded by Portland-based serial entrepreneur <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/courtney-couch">Courtney Couch</a>, along with <a target="_blank" href="http://jquerytools.org/">jQuery Tools</a> creator <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/tero-piirainen">Tero Piirainen</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/janne-lehtinen">Janne Lehtinen</a>, both of Helsinki. The team had <a target="_blank" href="http://flowplayer.org/about/">previously worked</a> on popular web video player <a target="_blank" href="http://flowplayer.org/">Flowplayer</a>, which is what led them to the idea to create Moot in the first place.</p>
<p>Explains Couch, &#8220;we were rebuilding Flowplayer&#8217;s site and restructuring everything. We had a separate support system and separate forums, and we wanted to have a completely static-generated site. And there wasn&#8217;t really anything available,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We could install a separate forum software, but all our options looked like they were from the 90s&#8230;there wasn&#8217;t any sort of unified system that would combine the content, combine the users from commenting and forums, and allow us the configurability to create our own options.&#8221;</p>
<p>So they built one. And it&#8217;s called <a target="_blank" href="http://moot.it/">Moot</a>.</p>
<p>The platform allows site owners to design their systems to function however they want.</p>
<p>Maybe you only need commenting, or maybe you want commenting and forums, or maybe you want some comments to appear on the forums. Maybe you want flat commenting. Or threaded. And maybe you want users to be able to comment using the same username and password they&#8217;re already using on your service today.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/05/goodbye-ugly-forums-moot-is-a-flexible-and-modern-platform-for-online-discussion-and-its-free/forums/" rel="attachment wp-att-793313"></a></p>
<p>Moot allows for this kind of flexibility, but it adds a number of other useful features, too, while removing others that the founders feel are extraneous to their core purpose of enabling online discussions. For example, posting inline photos and videos is not supported out of the box, but because Moot is configurable, a site owner could add these back in if it were mission-critical for them to do so.</p>
<p>Also not available are things like voting comments up or down, which Couch says can make following and replying to discussions confusing for users.</p>
<p>If Tumblr was the simpler form of blogging to the more powerful but complex WordPress, then Moot may be seen as the simpler commenting and discussion platform to the others on the market today. Just getting the basic forum up-and-running takes under a minute, notes Couch. Then it&#8217;s only a matter of copy-and-pasting some embed code.</p>
<p>While the most immediately noticeable thing about Moot is its clean and simple appearance, the <a target="_blank" href="http://moot.it/">Moot homepage gives a detailed look</a> at the other features that make the platform interesting. For example, forums can now offer a real-time feed of posts, and users can track their own interactions in a &#8220;My Feed&#8221; section, which is also realtime.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/05/goodbye-ugly-forums-moot-is-a-flexible-and-modern-platform-for-online-discussion-and-its-free/moot-feed/" rel="attachment wp-att-793325"></a></p>
<p>Search is also fast and grammar-aware, correcting misspellings on the fly and finding related words (e.g. a search for &#8220;configuring Pyton&#8221; would return posts with the phrase &#8220;configure Python&#8221;).</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/05/goodbye-ugly-forums-moot-is-a-flexible-and-modern-platform-for-online-discussion-and-its-free/forums-search/" rel="attachment wp-att-793312"></a></p>
<p>The rest of the discussion on the topic searched will appear collapsed, but can be expanded from the search interface. The discussions update in realtime here, too, and you can reply directly from the search results page with just a click. (See above.)</p>
<p>Site comments can be flat or threaded, but only one level deep to keep threads easier to follow, says Couch. Comments can be liked by others, and Moot uses this metadata along with Akismet by WordPress and community voting to help it manage spam. Admins can manage and remove comments from an online dashboard, as expected, which is also designed with ease-of-use in mind.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/05/goodbye-ugly-forums-moot-is-a-flexible-and-modern-platform-for-online-discussion-and-its-free/realtime-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-793327"></a></p>
<p>Users can be identified as being online or offline, which is indicated with a red or green button next to their usernames. Users get to create their own usernames, but they can&#8217;t change them after the fact. They also can&#8217;t edit or delete their comments after a brief grace period following their post. After 2.71 minutes (aka &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)">e</a>&#8220;), those comments become permanent unless an admin removes them.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reason for that is that if you ever come into a thread where people edited or deleted a post, you can&#8217;t follow it anymore,&#8221; says Couch. &#8220;It becomes incomprehensible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moot&#8217;s core product, which competes to some extent with platforms like Discourse, Livefyre, Disqus, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.forummatrix.org/">many</a> others, is free. The plan is to eventually charge for three advanced features: SSO (single sign-on) support ($20/month), custom branding ($5/month), and support for private forums ($10/month). These add-ons are not yet live, however.</p>
<p>In the meantime, interested site and forum owners can <a target="_blank" href="http://moot.it/">sign up to get started with the free platform here</a>.</p>

Now Readability, with has 5 million monthly active users stripping out and reading tens of millions of articles each day, is launching <a target="_blank" href="http://www.topreads.com">Top Reads</a>, a reading aggregation service of its own based on the most read stories on Readability, to get more people to spend more time on its platform.</p>
<p>Top Reads will launch first as a responsive web app for desktop and mobile screens, and Rich Ziade, one of Readability&#8217;s founders, says that there will be dedicated native mobile apps on the way in a matter of months if the response is good.</p>
<p>Top Reads is not exactly new &#8212; it a feature that first appeared as a list in Readability&#8217;s mobile app <a target="_blank" href="http://thenextweb.com/apps/2012/07/10/updated-readability-for-ios-boosts-content-discovery-with-top-reads-and-longform-picks-features/">last year</a>, and has been getting strong traffic since, with about two-thirds of the site&#8217;s 5 million users using it every month. Enough attention, he said, to get Ziade and his team to explore making it into a standalone service with its own URL.</p>
<p>&#8220;Discovery is a still big deal,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. &#8220;We&#8217;re getting swamped with stuff to read.&#8221; And while his app has developed a dedicated audience using it to read content they are finding themselves, this will help them look at what others are reading, too.</p>
<p>The new, more visual version looks more like Flipboard than text river, with pictures and links through to either read later, share, or read instantly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A click through to read instantly takes you to the actual web page, with a link at the top to read in Readability&#8217;s stripped-down format:</p>
<p></p>
<p>And this is what that format then looks like:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ziade says that Top Reads will also remain in Readability&#8217;s mobile app, which today accounts for just under half of all of the company&#8217;s traffic. Over time the two Top Reads will diverge in function: the in-app version will be a &#8220;best of&#8221; list, while the dedicated Top Reads site will display a much larger selection of content, with more features, like views of vertical subjects, coming soon.</p>
<p>Readability is currently funded by arc90, an app design studio based in New York, but the plan is to become a viable, standalone business. Ziade says Readability makes a modest revenue from licensing its &#8220;parsing engine&#8221; to a few device makers and other apps, which use it to present content on their own sites. Some of these are confidential; one that is Reeder, one of the companies aspiring to the soon-to-be-vacated Google Reader throne.</p>
<p>The idea will be to continue to build that out with more platform licensing deals, and to supplement that with big-data analytics based on discovering what kind of content is popular on the platform. Ziade says that just about every online publisher has had its content pass through Readability&#8217;s platform, so it becomes a huge repository of aggregated information about what is getting read. In that vein, getting more people reading and browsing through Top Reads will help further grow that dataset.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are already getting a really good sense of what people are reading on the web,&#8221; Ziade says. &#8220;Top Reads is the first step of surfacing that value.&#8221;</p>
<p>What&#8217;s interesting is that while services like Flipboard are &#8220;social&#8221; readers, with people using their social networks to share and discover content; Top Reads is a bit more old school, relying instead on a most-popular algorithm to select what goes on to its front page. The more something is read on Readability, the more likely it will appear on Top Reads. Crucially, the kind of data that Readability is putting together is not, for now at least, based on &#8220;learning&#8221; what you like or targeting you in any way. The data, and the user, remain anonymous.</p>
<p>There are social elements, too, however. Folling @topreads on Twitter, you will be able to get links to articles as the &#8220;heat up&#8221; on Readability. The same list will be accessible through the Readability app.</p>
<p>While services like Pocket are extending to other kinds of media like video, Top Reads, as its name implies, is going to stick to the written word. &#8220;We want to really capture behavior around reading,&#8221; Ziade says. &#8220;We are focused on shedding light on how people read. They say reading is dying, that people mostly read tweets these days, people are actually reading tons, and we want to be in the middle of that.&#8221;</p>

</span></p>
<p>Happy Anniversary! One year ago, U.S. lawmakers joined together with overwhelming bipartisan support to pass the JOBS Act. It was an exciting moment in history — one that my co-founders and I at Indiegogo didn&#8217;t expect to see for many years, especially not within just five years of launching our perks-based crowdfunding platform in 2008.</p>
<p>While the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rule-setting period has taken a bit longer than originally hoped and thus equity crowdfunding is taking longer to introduce than the Act anticipated, we&#8217;re quite pleased that the SEC is taking the process seriously.</p>
<h5><b>Regulations: A Hard Balance</b></h5>
<p>Striking a balance between the need for regulation and the danger of over-regulation is tricky. Too little regulation could lead to risky behavior — while too much regulation could stifle innovation and competition, and actually block the very economic activity equity crowdfunding is poised to create.</p>
<p>Crowdfunding rose into the mainstream long before the JOBS Act was passed. Since the launch of our perks-based approach to crowdfunding over five years ago – where entrepreneurs, artists and causes raise money in support of their dreams online by offering perks to funders &#8212; hundreds of other platforms have followed suit across the world.</p>
<p>When equity crowdfunding is introduced and allows funders actually to own a piece of the new businesses, pro-JOBS Act platforms like perk-based incumbents Indiegogo and Rockethub, or new equity-only players like Crowdfunder, will need to innovate by developing and testing new procedures that are safe, robust and customer-driven. As this is the first time equity crowdfunding will be possible in the Internet age, platforms need the opportunity to experiment, learn and build what customers actually need and want &#8212; rather than what regulators might think customers could want. Too much regulation could simply stifle the innovation required to make equity crowdfunding work.</p>
<p>Too much regulation could also reduce competition and lock out smaller equity crowdfunding platforms from launching, as burdensome regulation would make it expensive to get off the ground. Ironically, this would benefit well-resourced incumbents like us. But this is not what we would want.</p>
<h5><b>Indiegogo Perspective on the Risk of Over-Regulation</b></h5>
<p>For Indiegogo, we have a healthy and growing perks-based business and do not need equity crowdfunding to happen. That said we’d be disappointed if equity crowdfunding never has the chance to realize its innovation potential. The concept of equity crowdfunding is 100 percent in-line with our mission to make finance efficient and fair &#8212; removing gatekeepers from interfering with making dreams come true. We’ve innovated and developed an algorithm-driven platform in order to deliver a gatekeeper-free experience on our trusted perks platform. It would be disappointing &#8212; for example &#8211; if regulation somehow required us to put the gatekeeper back into the process, thus stifling our innovation and ability to make finance efficient and fair.</p>
<p>We’d also be disappointed if the regulation killed our competition, leaving us the sole player. As an equal opportunity platform, we’d defy our entire reason for being by hoping for a competition-free world.</p>
<p>Indiegogo pioneered crowdfunding as a way for people to fund what matters to them &#8212; whatever that might be. We don’t curate. We don&#8217;t judge. There are no gatekeepers on Indiegogo. We believe every idea (as long as it’s legal) deserves the right to connect with its audience and see if its audience is willing to fund it.</p>
<p>As a result of our inclusive approach, unique ideas &#8212; creative, cause and entrepreneurial &#8212; are coming to life through crowdfunding on Indiegogo as I write. They include the <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/activyst-bold-athletic-bags-that-help-girls-play-sports?website_name=activyst">Breathomete</a>r</span> that turns a smartphone into a breathalyzer, the athletic bag company<a target="_blank" href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/activyst-bold-athletic-bags-that-help-girls-play-sports?website_name=activyst"> Activyst</a> that supports girls sports programs across the world, and the band <a target="_blank" href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/avasa-matty-love-new-album"> Avasa &amp; Matty</a>, a husband-wife duo working on their next album. Even the world’s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/help-the-haleys-have-a-baby?website_name=babyhaley">first baby</a> was crowdfunded last year. (The campaign helped a family pay for in-vitro fertilization). These ideas are not alone. Every week, Indiegogo distributes millions of dollars in four currencies to campaigns in every country.</p>
<p>Given we aren’t in the business of curation, we want to empower as many people around the world as possible. Nothing proves this better than the fact that we not only allowed, but often recognized that we had <a target="_blank" href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/startsomegood-com?website_name=StartSomeGood">another crowdfunding platform</a> use Indiegogo to raise money to launch.</p>
<p>So if the rules were up to us, given our inclusive approach and equal-opportunity philosophy, we would opt for a more open environment where platforms could innovate and compete freely to prove themselves superior, even if that meant more competition for us.</p>
<h5><b>Despite Delays, Crowdfunding Continues To Grow</b></h5>
<p>At Indiegogo, we&#8217;re excited to see the SEC release the rules. However, even without equity crowdfunding, new businesses have continued to thrive on Indiegogo. In the last year since the JOBS Act passed, more than 15,000 entrepreneurial campaigns raised money on Indiegogo in the U.S. alone.</p>
<p>Businesses like the first package-free grocery store <a target="_blank" href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/in-gredients?website_name=ingredients">In.gredients</a> raised $15,000 to open its doors. Due to the market validation from crowdfunding, now traditional financiers are calling the team to ask how they can help the business expand. Innovative products like the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/1-face-watch">1:Face Watch,</a> raised more than $357,000 to bring their watch to market, while giving people the opportunity to support the cause of their choice. Due to the risk-mitigation benefits of crowdfunding, the team didn’t face the risk of overproduction or underproduction.</p>
<p>Shareconomy ventures like the mobile canning service for craft brewers <a target="_blank" href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/get-the-can-van-rolling?website_name=The-Can-Van">The Can Van</a> also benefitted by garnering publicity they never could have imagined through their campaign. Due to social media integration, crowdfunding helped this team turn supporters into grassroots marketers overnight.</p>
<p>These job-creating endeavors and their entrepreneurial neighbors on Indiegogo received money from more than 200,000 people across all 50 states who voted with their dollars to bring these ideas to life. This clearly demonstrates how crowdfunding provides a catalyst not just for funding, but for traction, awareness and market validation as well.  I wonder what the numbers would be when equity is part of the picture &#8212; when the JOBS Act turns two. Exciting times are ahead. History in the making.</p>

<p>PETMAN is a humanoid robot made by Boston Dynamics. BD also created Big Dog, the quadrupedal, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/01/big-dog-can-now-throw-cinder-blocks-thereby-making-it-the-scariest-robot-ever/">brick-throwing robot</a> that haunts our dreams.</p>
<p>This robot, shown here gussied up in a hazmat suit and gas mask, however, is far scarier. While I doubt he can do much right now without those cable support, just imagine PETMAN bopping up to you on a mission to keep you from entered a contaminated zone. First, he looks surprisingly life-like in this outfit and, second, he would be completely deaf to your entreaties. As they say, we&#8217;re living in the future. It&#8217;s just not evenly distributed yet.</p>
<p>Plus, PETMAN can dance.</p>

First, they sound incredibly annoying. Secondly, there isn’t an easy way to turn them off.

DoorJamz provides a solution for both of these problems. It’s still a doorbell, but instead of the consistently infuriating “ding-dong”, you can choose to have it play whatever you like. If can have <a target="_blank" href="http://t.co/BSQiyg2NBx">Led Zeppelin’s Kashmir</a> play whenever your guests or the Jehovah Witnesses announce their presence. That's pretty cool.

<p>I have two problems with doorbells. First, they sound incredibly annoying. Secondly, there isn’t an easy way to turn them off.</p>
<p>DoorJamz provides a solution for both of these problems. It’s still a doorbell, but instead of the consistently infuriating “ding-dong”, you can choose to have it play whatever you like. If can have <a target="_blank" href="http://t.co/BSQiyg2NBx">Led Zeppelin’s Kashmir</a> play whenever your guests or the Jehovah Witnesses announce their presence. That&#8217;s pretty cool.</p>
<p>The DoorJamz is controlled from an app on your smartphone. Once a particular song or sound file is uploaded unto the app, it wirelessly transmits your new doortone to the DoorJamz.</p>
<p>From the app, you can also schedule to have certain doortones ring on certain days. For example, on Halloween you can set your DoorJamz to play a howling wolf, a cackling witch, or maybe an audio recording of you screaming “I DON’T HAVE CANDY” followed by a long string of curses whenever those trick or treaters come to call.</p>
<p>But the best feature, and one parents everywhere will appreciate, is that you can lower the DoorJamz’s volume whenever you want. So if your baby is napping during the day, you can basically mute the DoorJamz until they wake up. It&#8217;s insane that the doorbells we have now can&#8217;t do this.</p>
<p>A DoorJamz can be had for a $99 contribution at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/doorjamz-customizable-doortone-for-your-home">their IndieGogo page</a>. They’re trying to raise $90,000 by May 1st.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a new handy little device for people who like to drink but want to be safe about it. The <a target="_blank" href="http://breathometer.com">Breathometer</a>, which is currently for sale through a campaign on Indiegogo, was built to use the processing power of your mobile phone to provide an affordable way to allow users to check their blood alcohol content. And I got to take it for a spin.</p>
<p>Breathometer founder Charles Michael Yim said that he had tried a few different consumer breathalyzers and found none of them were all that convenient. They were too bulky, too expensive, and cumbersome in terms of having to calibrate them. Most people are probably not aware of the availability of consumer breathalyzers, and so Yim and his team decided to make a device that was more affordable and accessible for the average consumer.</p>
<p>The Breathometer is available as part of an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/breathometer-a-smartphone-breathalyzer">Indiegogo campaign</a> that the company is running now through April 13. It&#8217;s structured in a way that how soon you&#8217;ll receive a device depends on how much you contribute. So someone who contributes $100 will be part of the company&#8217;s first drop-shipment of the device in July, whereas someone who puts in just $20 shouldn&#8217;t expect the device before early next year.</p>
<p>I had a few drinks ahead of the interview, to try the thing out for myself, and, well, for science. What I found was that the Breathometer was accurate in establishing that Yim was stone-cold sober, while I blew a 0.04. And while that means I was probably ok to drive, maybe I shouldn&#8217;t have been conducting a video interview under the influence. Whew. Check out the full video above!</p>

If you click on the icon, you&#8217;ll get the option to avoid any interest-based ad targeting from TRUSTe partners, or to avoid any Drawbridge ads. Once you&#8217;ve opted out, that choice will apply across all the devices that Drawbridge knows are yours, Sivaramakrishnan said — she described it as &#8220;a very conservative approach to privacy preference management.&#8221;</p>

<p>VP of Product Eric Rosenblum added, &#8220;We always felt that a strong commitment to privacy controls was going to be important to our business model.&#8221; He noted that not many people actually use AdChoices to opt out, but it&#8217;s important to offer the option, he said, because &#8220;it would be a pity to in any way inhibit [cross-device ad targeting's] growth because of people&#8217;s concerns about privacy.&#8221; And even if you don&#8217;t opt out, he and Sivaramakrishnan said that from the start, Drawbridge has not collected any personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>I also asked whether the approach that Drawbridge takes to privacy might change if people become more comfortable with the technology over time, and Sivaramakrishnan said, &#8220;&#8221;We want to be setting the standard around this. But look, it&#8217;s an evolving space, it&#8217;s a new space. It&#8217;s sort of the next frontier. &#8230; That&#8217;s not to say there won&#8217;t be new thought processes along the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Drawbridge&#8217;s integration with AdChoices went live last week.</p>
